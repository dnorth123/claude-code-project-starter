# Example Complex Project

This is an example of a complex project using full BUILD-STATUS.md tracking.

## Why Use BUILD-STATUS.md?

For complex projects with multiple phases, BUILD-STATUS.md provides:
- Phase tracking and progress monitoring
- Context/token usage management
- Session logging
- Key decisions documentation
- Easy resume after breaks

## Setup

This project was created from the cc-project-starter-template:

```bash
cd ~/Projects/projects/personal
cp -r ../../.workspace/templates/project-starter example-complex-project
cd example-complex-project
# Follow planning phase in BUILD-STATUS.md
```

## Usage with Claude Code
